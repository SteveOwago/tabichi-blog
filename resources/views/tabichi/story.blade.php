					<h2>Peter Tabichi is The first teacher to win a global Award</h2>
					<div class="text">Raised in a remote village, in a family of teachers. Growing up, he faced various challenges including losing his mother at the age of 11. He saw first-hand dedication that teachers bring to the community and he has come to view teacher’s role as enlightening others on how to tackle the challenges in life. With great encouragement from his family, he worked hard to pursue those interests. He graduated in Egerton University with a degree in Bachelor of Education in Science</div>

					<div class="text" style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; color: black; margin-top: 20px;">He graduated in Egerton University with a degree in Bachelor of Education in Science. He joined the religious life because he wanted to be able to dedicate himself whole heartedly in helping others. He joined the Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in 2015. The school is in a semi-arid village in Rift valley province, a region impacted by famine and drought. Tabichi donates 80% of his salary to supporting pupils in the Pwani Village. The school population is made up of seven different tribes, with around 95% of students living in poverty and one third live with only one parent. The School only has one computer, intermittent access to the internet and a student-teacher ratio of 58:1. Tabichi integrates the use of digital teaching in most of his lessons, and launched the Talent Nurturing Club, which has dramatically improved attendance. He also established a peace club, uniting representatives who have been involved with violence. He engages with local communities; teaching residents how to grow crops that can resist famine.</div>
